There are two other options available, if we don't want to define a custom locationBuilder ourselves.

#### With a List of BeamLocations

BeamerLocationBuilder can be used with a list of BeamLocations. This builder will automatically select the correct BeamLocation based on its pathPatterns or return a NotFound if none matches.

```dart
final routerDelegate = BeamerDelegate(
  locationBuilder: BeamerLocationBuilder(
    beamLocations: [
      HomeLocation(),
      BooksLocation(),
    ],
  ),
);
```

#### With a Map of Routes

We can use the RoutesLocationBuilder with a map of routes, as mentioned in <a href='/quick-start/routes-stack-builder'>Quick Start</a>. This completely removes the need for custom BeamLocations, but also gives the least amount of customization. Still, wildcards and path parameters are supported as with all the other options.

```dart
final routerDelegate = BeamerDelegate(
  locationBuilder: RoutesLocationBuilder(
    routes: {
      '/': (context, state, data) => HomeScreen(),
      '/books': (context, state, data) => BooksScreen(),
      '/books/:bookId': (context, state, data) =>
        BookDetailsScreen(
          bookId: state.pathParameters['bookId'],
        ),
    },
  ),
);
```

Navigation is done by **beaming**.

One can think of it as teleporting (beaming) to another place in your app. Similar to `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed('/my-route')`, but Beamer is not limited to a single page, nor to a push per se. BeamLocations produce a stack of pages that get built when you beam there. Beaming can feel like using many of Navigator's push/pop methods at once.

```dart
// Basic beaming
Beamer.of(context).beamToNamed('/books/2');

// Beaming with an extension method on BuildContext
context.beamToNamed('/books/2');

// Beaming with additional data that persist
// throughout navigation within the same BeamLocation
context.beamToNamed('/book/2', data: MyObject());
```
